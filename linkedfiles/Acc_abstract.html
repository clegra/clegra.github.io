<H2>Abstract for my talk at the OZSL-Accolade, 27th October 2000, Nunspeet, NL:</H2>


<H3>Clemens GRABMAYER: 
   ``Proof-Theoretic Interconnections between known Inference- and
     Axiom-Systems for Recursive Type Equality''
</H3>

<p>
Recursive Types are prime examples for cylic objects occurring in
Computer Science. Although algorithms for deciding, whether
or not two recursive types are equivalent, have existed and been
implemented in certain functional computer-languages for
some time now, formal systems that allow the treatment of
recursive type equivalence in a precise logical manner
are fairly recent. 
</p>

<p>
There are in particular (1) the axiomatization by R.~Amadio and
L.~Cardelli (1993), (2) the axiomatization by M.~Brandt and F.~Henglein
(1998) using a co-inductive derivation-rule, and (3) a
syntactic matching inference-system as e.g. presented by Z.M.~Ariola 
and J.W.~Klop (1995), which can be used for consistency-testing of the
equivalence of two given types.
</p>

<p>
In my talk I do want (a) to speak briefly about the motivation for
recursive types in computer science, (b) to introduce the mentioned
systems formally, (c) to give an example for a ``duality'' discovered by
Prof.~Klop between derivations in the Brandt-Henglein-system and 
``consistency checks'' in the syntactic-matching system and (d) to 
report shortly on which else proof-theoretic connections between these 
three kinds of systems I have found so far.
