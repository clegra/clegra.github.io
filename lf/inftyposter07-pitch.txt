C.G. for project `Infinity': We are interested in infinite mathematical
objects such as infinite sequences and infinite trees.
An example you can see right on top: the famous Thue Morse sequence,
a stream of zeros and ones that is aperiodic, full of symmetries, and
can be visualised as a beautiful mosaic.

The project links together three research groups in Amsterdam and
Utrecht as well as three different fields: term rewriting, coalgebra,
and proof theory.

To mention only one result: we just submitted a paper concerning
the question of `productivity': How can it be recognised whether
a given stream definition evaluates to a unique infinite stream?
This is an undecidable problem. But for a rich subclass we have found
and implemented a substantially new decision algorithm that can be
useful for functional programming practice.
